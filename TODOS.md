## P1 — High Priority (Next Sprint)

### ~~Role-Aware Coaching Knowledge Base~~ ✅
**Status:** Shipped
**What was built:** 10 role-specific coaching knowledge bases (PM, EM, Engineer, Founder/CEO, Designer, Sales, Marketing, Ops, Data, People/HR) with curated frameworks from Shreyas Doshi, Paul Graham, Sam Altman, Chris Voss, Marty Cagan, and others. Settings role field upgraded from free text to dropdown selector. Each role gets deep, tailored coaching with meeting-specific advice and metrics focus.
**Files:** `electron/main/models/coaching-kb.ts` (new), `llm-engine.ts` (enhanced), `SettingsPage.tsx` (role dropdown)

### Fix Corrupted icon.icns
**What:** The macOS app icon (.icns) was regenerated but may still cause issues in packaged builds. Verify with `npm run package` that the app opens correctly.
**Why:** App won't open after packaging — critical blocker for distribution.
**Effort:** S
**Status:** Regenerated in this session — needs verification

## P2 — Medium Priority (Next 2 Sprints)

### Meeting Prep Briefs
**What:** 5 minutes before a calendar meeting, generate a contextual brief: who you're meeting, what you discussed last time, your open commitments to them, and suggested talking points. Deliver as macOS notification + in-app card.
**Why:** This is the "killer feature" that makes the memory layer tangible. The "Before you go in..." notification is the wow moment that makes someone tell a friend.
**Where to start:** `electron/main/memory/prep-brief.ts` — query people table + note_people + commitments for calendar attendees, then LLM call to generate 3-5 line brief. Trigger from CalendarContext when upcoming meeting detected.
**Effort:** M
**Depends on:** Memory Layer (shipped), Calendar integration (shipped), accumulated meeting data (needs ~5+ meetings)

### Weekly Intelligence Digest
**What:** Auto-generated weekly summary: meeting load, key themes, commitments kept/broken, coaching score trends, relationship highlights. Delivered as in-app page + optional notification.
**Why:** Makes Syag valuable even between meetings. Shows the pattern of your professional life over time.
**Where to start:** `electron/main/memory/weekly-digest.ts` + `src/pages/WeeklyDigestPage.tsx`. Aggregate from notes, commitments, coaching_metrics, topics tables. Schedule via `setInterval` or calendar-based trigger.
**Effort:** L
**Depends on:** Memory Layer (shipped), 1+ weeks of accumulated data

### "Before you go in..." Smart Notification
**What:** Enhancement to prep briefs — the notification itself is contextual: "Meeting with Sarah Chen in 5 min — last discussed Q3 budget, you owe her the revised forecast." Tapping opens prep brief in-app.
**Why:** This is the "tell a friend" moment. Generic "meeting in 5 min" notifications are boring. Context-aware ones are magical.
**Effort:** S (once prep briefs are built)
**Depends on:** Meeting Prep Briefs

## P3 — Lower Priority (Backlog)

### Microsoft Teams Call Integration
**What:** Integrate with Teams calls — detect active calls, capture audio from Teams meetings specifically.
**Why:** User requested. Meeting detector already handles Zoom/Google Meet. Teams webhook integration exists but not call detection.
**Effort:** M
**Depends on:** Meeting detector infrastructure (shipped)

### SettingsPage Decomposition
**What:** Break the 1,692-line `SettingsPage.tsx` god component into `src/components/settings/` directory with separate section components.
**Why:** Code quality — the file is the largest in the codebase and hard to maintain.
**Effort:** M (refactor only, no new features)

### Vector Embeddings / Semantic Search
**What:** Add embedding-based search across meetings. "What did we decide about pricing?" → semantic match across notes, not just keyword search.
**Why:** Makes the memory layer 10x more powerful. Currently limited to exact text matches.
**Effort:** L (needs embedding pipeline, vector storage, search UI)
**Depends on:** Memory Layer (shipped)

### Team Features
**What:** Multi-user support — shared meeting memory, delegation tracking, team meeting culture analytics.
**Why:** Transforms Syag from personal tool to team platform.
**Effort:** XL (auth, sharing, permissions, sync)
**Depends on:** Everything above
