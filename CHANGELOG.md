## [1.3.2]

- **Action items:** Summaries default to **unassigned** owners; no auto-**Me**/**You** from the model. Optional `accountDisplayName` on summarize for assignee normalization.
- **Jira:** Icon-only control in the action-items table (no visible “Jira” label).
- **Coaching:** Meeting-effectiveness prompt and UI (transcript + role first); metrics-only coaching as fallback when transcript analysis fails; supporting signals labeled as secondary.

## [1.3.1]

- **Conversation coaching (Work Coach–style):** Transcript-grounded analysis with headline, narrative, evidence-linked micro-insights, habit tags, and key moments (jump-to in transcript). Role KB excerpt + deterministic heuristics (questions, monologue, sales cues). Cross-meeting synthesis on Coaching page; optional audio clips documented as future opt-in (`docs/coaching-audio-opt-in.md`).
- **Tray agenda:** Tray window / agenda sync flow (`tray-agenda-window`, `TrayAgendaPage`, `TrayAgendaSync`).
- **Capture & STT:** Per-channel Whisper context continuity; mic debug logging merged with buffer drain fixes; calendar sync labels (`getSyncLabel`).
- **Docs:** `docs/local-stt-setup.md`, `docs/optional-provider-install.md`, `docs/transcript-me-them.md`, README architecture reference.
- **Repo hygiene:** `.cursor/` in `.gitignore`.

## [1.3.0]

- **Screenshot / recording privacy:** Content protection replaced with window hide/show; Syag can be hidden from screen share during recording.
- **Local Llama:** Summarization and chat when using a local model now use fixed context (8192) and 4 threads to avoid overwhelming the machine.
- **Optional providers:** Copart removed from the main repo; optional providers (e.g. Copart) can be loaded from `userData/optional-providers/`. See docs for installing optional providers.

## [1.1.2]

- **Audio reliability & zombie process fix:** Safer cleanup of STT workers and processes.
- **Safe JSON parse:** More robust parsing for stored transcript/summary data.
- **UI/data:** Built-in template list and tests added (`src/data/templates.ts`, `src/data/__tests__/templates.test.ts`).
- **Optional providers:** Generic optional-provider loader; Copart removed from repo (available as optional provider).

## [1.1.1]

- **Same codebase as 1.1.0**, with **Copart built-in** (no optional-provider setup required).
- Tag `v1.1.1` points to the same commit as `v1.1.0` for testing the pre–optional-provider setup.

## [1.1.0]

- **Read-only Agent API** via Unix domain socket for AI agents and tools to query notes locally.
- **Copart Genie** built-in for chat and STT when configured in Settings.
- Core meeting notes, summaries, calendar, and coaching features.

## Maintaining this log

- **On every release:** Add a new `## [X.Y.Z]` section at the top (below this note) with bullet points for what changed in that release.
- **When tagging:** Run your usual release flow; keep the tag and the CHANGELOG section in sync so `git show vX.Y.Z` and the log match.
- **Optional:** Copy the release notes into the GitHub Release body when creating the release.
