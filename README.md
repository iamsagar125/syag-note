# Syag

A private, on-device meeting companion for macOS. Syag records your meetings, transcribes them in real time, generates structured summaries, and coaches you to communicate better — all without your data leaving your machine.

## What Syag does

**Record & transcribe** — Capture mic and system audio simultaneously with live speaker-labeled transcription ("You" vs "Others"). Works with Zoom, Google Meet, Teams, or any audio source.

**AI summaries** — After a meeting, get a structured summary: overview, key points, action items with assignees and due dates, decisions, and open questions. Customize the output with your own prompt templates.

**Knowledge base suggestions** — Point Syag at a folder of your notes. During a live call, it searches your knowledge base and surfaces relevant talking points in real time.

**Role-aware coaching** — Post-meeting coaching tuned to your role (PM, Engineer, Sales, Founder, Designer, etc.) with a communication mix breakdown and LLM-generated insights drawn from frameworks by top thought leaders.

**People & relationships** — Syag automatically extracts the people you meet with. View, edit, merge duplicates, and track your meeting history with each person.

**Calendar integration** — Connect Google Calendar or Microsoft 365 to see upcoming meetings and auto-detect when a call starts.

**Agent API** — A read-only Unix socket API for AI agents and tools to query your notes programmatically. Local-only, token-authenticated, zero network exposure.

**Hidden from screen share** — A single toggle hides Syag from screen sharing so other participants never see it.
